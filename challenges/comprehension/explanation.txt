IIn this language:
% represent something like strings.
$ represent arrays, something like string[] in this case.
@ represents a more complex collection, something like a Dictionary<string, int> in this case.

The program main.wat counts the number of times unique alpha numeric strings appear in the input.txt file, and then prints the result.

It does this by iterating line by line through input.txt, setting %temp equal to the line each iteration.
It then splits %temp into an array to substrings, split along spaces.
It then loops through this array of strings and checks if each is alpha numeric. 
If it is, then it checks the @storage collection to see if the current string has already been found. 
	If so, it increments the value for that key by one. 
	If not, it creates a new key for that string and sets the value to 1. 
After the program has iterated through all the lines to input.txt, it then iterates through all the keys in the @storage collection and prints (presumably to the console) each unique key, followed by a space, followed by the number of times the string appeared in the txt file, followed by a new line.
